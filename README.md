# JPACRUDProject

## Project Description
This is a web form for viewing and recording data about when you stub your toe! Everyone knows that keeping track of the moments when you stub your toe is essential to success in business, love, health, and coding. 

The home page for this project allows you to search for a toe stub by an id number, or to create a new toe stub entry. Searching by id will bring up all relevant data about said toe stub. It will also include options for updating or deleting the toe stub. There is also a link for navigation back to the front page.

If you choose to update a toe stub, a form will appear that will have you update the relevant information about the toe stub. Submitting the form will update the information in the mysql database. Selecting delete will remove the given toe stub from the database. Careful! there are no take-backsies in the world of toe stubs!

Selecting the link to add a toe stub from the home page will navigate the user to a form where they will fill in all the relevant information about their toe stub. Ouch!


## Technologies Used

 - JPA
 - mysql
 - jsp

 ## Lessons Learned
 - There are a lot of moving parts between the DAO, controllers, jsps and entities. It's really easy to mispell a field name, or forget an annotation. 
 - Stubbing your toe is painful! avoid at all costs!
 - This was a lot of fun! It's really cool to see all the work we've been putting in since November finally start to come to fruition. I know there is still way more to learn, but it's nice to be able to create a real web page!
